Battered and bruised
from clueless missions spread   - Allusion: "The People, Their Missions"
Layering back my small color    - Allusion: "Superficial"
I mask myself, because
there's everything
and nothing                     - Allusion: "Everything and Nothing"
left wondering
the losing not lost             - Allusion: "Questioning"
the sides of who I am
My dream hesitation             - Allusion: "Behind Out"

I needed,
the only thing not broken,
a broken clock
a comfort stuck
No reflections
Holding on with no Name
                                - Allusion: "Broken" by Lifehouse

I'm crowded by the weight
of my own content
Afraid to live out of myself
Afraid to get out
For the fear of being noticed
thought of,
seen,
Known
                                - Stanza taken from poem "Crowded"

Battered and bruised
lost
from failings
bruises outward
inward realizations

Stop
the belief
the support
I don't deserve

My work is worthless
My thinking, no use     - I often have interesting, but unpractical/useless, ideas
I remember
from time               - memorizing information comes more from time than intelligence
from
unfinished thoughts
thrown away, lost
unfinished work         - Most of my thoughts and work has been unfished, unwritten, and/or lost
unfinished learning
		</pre>

		<div class="section">Explanation</div>
		<p>
			The first allusion I make is to my poem "The People, Their Missions". The original lines from this poem are as follows:
		</p>
		<pre>
The people their missions
their clueless sickness
that spreads the world
		</pre>

		<p>
			"The People, Their Missions" is about being overwhelmed
			with emotions from all the bad that happens within the
			world, and wanting to find some way to block it all out
			and not have to feel anymore. I was struggling with
			recurring thoughts about all the evil within the world,
			not able to forget. I think it is likely this poem was
			written before every other poem of mine that I allude to
			here, so this is the start of me trying to block everything
			out.
		</p>

		<p>
			The next poem I allude to is "Superficial". Some of the main
			ideas behind this poem was to show hidden emotions, being
			misunderstood, and a lowering of self-esteem and confidence
			as time goes on (the yellowing/"lost color" and the peeling back
			of the onion), yet also trying, and failing, to stand up for
			oneself (the lengthening of each subsequent stanza).
		</p>
		<p>
			Onions generally make your eyes tear up. These are fake ("artificial")
			tears because they have no emotion behind them. These fake tears are in
			response to the "cursing", a means of protecting oneself when their
			protection has been peeled off. "Regardless of the benefits" represents
			the message of this "cursing". The stinging in your eyes and the cursing
			from the onion, while seemingly painful, have a message, a message that
			has deliberately not been heard.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next stanza gives a clue that this onion is really a person who has
			feelings, yet feel like they cannot show it ("yet shown not"). Feelings
			are inward, and the inability to show them, masking oneself, is outward.
			Two "must"s follow, an inward must and an outward must, following in the
			same pattern as described above. The next line explains that what appears to
			be selfish (an outward selfish) is actually selfless (an inward selfless).
			You'll see this pattern continue in the next stanzas.
		</p>
		<p>
			The idea of absorbing illnesses comes back. The onion takes all of the pain
			from the outer world, and from what could be considered home ("origin waters")
			and absorbes it. This is the cause of the lost color (yellowing) from before.
			This pain has a lasting effect, even though the outward image remains ("truly
			remains") stable, superficial ("truly superficial").
		</p>

		<p>
			The next allusion made is to my poem "Everything and Nothing", which is about
			having thoughts of not belonging in the world and not wanting to be in it. It also
			talks about how certain relationships have only caused pain, making the person angry,
			not themselves, and increasing the desire to not want to feel anymore. Yet while not
			wanting to feel anymore, the feelings and pain never really stop.
		</p>

		<p>
			The allusion to Questioning was made because of thoughts that I didn't belong in
			the world because I was different. Thoughts of being scared to tell anyone about this
			for fear of being ostracized or misunderstood. But also, questions about why I am
			the way that I am and whether I was a bad person for that.
		</p>

		<p>
			The line "My dream hesitation" comes from the poem "Behind Out" and, which isn't on the website
			due to how personal it is. "Behind Out" is a poem about my feelings while writing my poem "Out",
			another very personal poem that hasn't been added to the site yet. Behind Out deals with questions
			about how I didn't choose the way that I am, to feel horrible and afraid everyday for the way that
			I am, and questions about how a God could not accept me for something that I couldn't control, yet
			wanting a longing personal connection with God very badly. This leads into the next stanza very well.
		</p>

		<p>
			The second stanza takes the message of the song "Broken" by Lifehouse, and turns part of the message.
			"Broken" is about holding on to God even when you have doubts and pain in your life. It's about finding
			God healing you even when you are at your lowest point in life and don't want to be healed.
		</p>

		<p>
			The first 4 lines of this stanza refer to this part of the lyrics of the song:
		</p>
		<pre>
The broken clock is a comfort
It let's me sleep tonight
Maybe it can stop tomorrow
From stealing all my time
		</pre>

		<p>
			The idea is that I wanted time to stop, for life to stop moving, to be comforted by complete pause of
			the constant pain and suffering that life brings - "a broken clock / a comfort stuck". Yet, the clock
			would never break for me. The line "No reflections" refers to these lines in the song:
		</p>
		<pre>
I still see your reflection
Inside my eyes
That are looking for purpose
There still looking for life
		</pre>
		<p>
			These lines are talking about God. In this time in my life I couldn't see how there could be a God. Everything
			about the world showed me that either a God couldn't exist, or that God was cruel. The last line of this stanza
			is me holding on as much as I can without anyone there, especially God ("Name" is capitalized).
		</p>

		<p>
			The next stanza is about my social anxiety, about not being able to freely express myself, about not being comfortable
			with communicating with people, about being afraid of this and of generally just being out in the world, of being known
			and noticed. This is part of the reason why I was so locked up in myself. I couldn't get comfort from anywhere else because
			of these fears.
