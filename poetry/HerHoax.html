Despicable
the hate, the blame
the lies, the claims
Spread abroad,
desire of attention
wicked in ways unspeakable -
Not to mention

Yet, spoken
Yet, defended
Yet, unwise
Yet, contended

Going against perception
throwing knives -
didn't really read?
Didn't really know
Perception is weak

Blame
Blame for truth,
for defense,
for compassion
Her selfish ways
they seek the glory of destruction
A human's curse

Yet perception doesn't always know
the heatache, the pain
the reason for knives that go

But were there knives?
Not until she gave them
Not until she disguised them
with fakery only known
to the people who understand

They sit in the sidelines
Not detecting this hoax
Not knowing the side with the most loss
from the deceoption that surrounds
from the hoax
that they don't see
don't hear, don't believe

How should they?
She's the master of it
Much practice given
then taken
from the ones she's spent
A portion of herself
The giving to her don't faze
