Fake Revolutions of Fake Hearts
washed up moral compasses
thrown out to sea
on a whim and a fancy
of who can be
the most found in the end
In the end when their lies
of slurs projected
views twisted and selected
like the Hitler tribe
persuade the saints
to follow in line

of Independent Disingenuous Works
and manipulators
Sured In
degrees of thoughts
directing boughts
to their works of frauds
Not knowing where to end
Not knowing where to lend
the destruction of the Hearts
as they go by fending
their due against
unspecial crews
who can't think for themselves
and require the acceptance
of Miss Improve Yourself

I have a fuel to burn
from the controversy
pointing a finger
at the ones
who pulled the trigger
pointed at me
with their bullshit
flying to tear
trying to flare
the burns of their
heartless
tilted stage and reactions,
prescribing the gun,
to me, and him,
and anyone who disagrees
with their roles
and their views
and their truths
tilted
with bruises
of shaped disapprovements
and manufactured
improvements
narcissistic decencies
validated reasons
of invalidated treasons
betraying the people
who sees in
stupid pleasings
squeezing
the chieftancy
evilly secrets
are breezily
quilted
and lifted
and shifted
above all the stilted

and I...
and I
I resisted, unscripted
unassisted, contradicted
yet predicted
(they insisted)

and I
feel the burn of the thousand cuts
a fire, a fuel
a light to see through
what not to do,
resisting shifting truths,
relative loops,
and religious feuds

and I
am still standing.
