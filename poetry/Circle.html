Claiming opponents
want less freedom
while also criticizing
their opposition
to restrictions
on freedoms
by the people
who kill for no reason
because they aren't trained

as if it's better
to kill people
when in doubt
than to keep the most
people alive at all costs
as if it's necessary
because at least
the killers aren't dead
because at least
the killers' "protection"
isn't diminished
because at least
they live to kill
another day

getting them before they can
get you
as if they would have thought to
as if they would have needed to

Claiming they
want less freedom
while also criticizing
their defense

on freedoms
by the people
who kill for no reason
because they aren't trained

as if it wasn't necessary
as if it's better
to let them be killed
when in doubt
than to keep the most
people alive at all costs
because at least
you aren't dead
because at least
your protection
isn't diminished
because at least
you live to kill
another day

as if you weren't taught this
as if they weren't taught this.
