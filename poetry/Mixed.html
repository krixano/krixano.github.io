I am holding on
to the memories
stuck sounds in my mind
broken hearts, turbulence,
quips and nicknames
regards lost

Every human has
a heart
easily broke,
easily fraught
moving strong,
and moving on
confused
and misunderstood

They gave me respect
and bridges with tries,
talks and comfort
conversations worth sharing
they gave
my frets lost

doubts I’m wrong
longing what I might have lost
searching for the light
to see through
trading my worth
for the hatred,
wanting everything

My insecurities
used against me
to push me in their line
claiming no assumptions
I am not going nowhere
just because I am not where
others want me to be,
I am still standing,

but not driving
The fright of intentions
the unknown, regrets in
assumptions and vests
handling my protection
from head games
seeing bad where it isn’t there
wanting nothing

Trading my worth
for the perceived accepts,
because at least I’m seen
my names called
comforted across
my worries lost

Every human has
a view
to protect the world
to improve
to try their best

Stuck echoes in my mind
monopolizing my thoughts
No assumptions
for their pushes
No responsibilities
for their hatred
No care
respect lost

I’m broke,
they say,
Maybe I’m broke.
I’m holding on
to the memories
stuck in my mind,
seeing good where it isn’t there,
Is it there?
Respect and bridges with tries,
my insecurities used against me,
Talks and comfort,
yet no care
Telling me to trust,
yet assuming no roles
Telling me to forgive,
while espousing intolerance
Are we who we are?
Or what we want?
