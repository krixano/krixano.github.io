			<strong>Wood - Alder</strong>
			<br>Alder is an unyielding wood, yet I have
			discovered that its ideal owner is not stubborn or
			obstinate, but often helpful, considerate and most
			likeable. Whereas most wand woods seek similarity in
			the characters of those they will best serve, alder is
			unusual in that it seems to desire a nature that is,
			if not precisely opposite to its own, then certainly of
			a markedly different type. When an alder wand is happily
			placed, it becomes a magnificent, loyal helpmate. Of all
			wand types, alder is best suited to non-verbal spell work,
			whence comes its reputation for being suitable only for
			the most advanced witches and wizards.
			<br><br>

			<strong>Core - Unicorn Hair</strong>
			<br>Unicorn hair generally produces the most
			consistent magic, and is least subject to fluctuations
			and blockages. Wands with unicorn cores are generally the
			most difficult to turn to the Dark Arts. They are the most
			faithful of all wands, and usually remain strongly attached
			to their first owner, irrespective of whether he or she was
			an accomplished witch or wizard. Minor disadvantages of
			unicorn hair are that they do not make the most powerful
			wands (although the wand wood may compensate) and that
			they are prone to melancholy if seriously mishandled,
			meaning that the hair may 'die' and need replacing.
